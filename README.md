## Project Description
 > When deciding on our project, we wanted to make a project that could be enjoyed over a long period of time as well as making a project that was easy to understand or already well known in terms of rules and how it's played. That's how we decided on making a blackjack project in order to fulfill those goals we had in mind. We're going to be using C++ for our project. This blackjack game includes a stack of cards without the 2 joker cards. You are given an amount of credits and if the your credits gets to 0 you are unable to play. The dealer is going to pass out 2 cards to itself (only revealing 1 card) and 2 cards to the player. After seeing the 2 cards, the player is going to have the options to hit (takes another card from the card stack), stand (take no more cards), double down (double the wager, take one more card and stand), split (this option is only avalable if the inital 2 cards given to you are the same value; split your 2 initial cards into 2 hands doubling your wager), and surrender (give up half of the bet and give up the hand). The project is expected to output the status of the blackjack game which includes, the player's hand, the dealer's hand, with the addition to different playstyle options mentioned before.
 > 
 > ## Phase II
 > In our project, everything will be reliant on the card class. The card class holds the value of each card, its respective suit, and the card's name. The deck class will store all our card objects in a vector which will be distributed to a player's hand. In the hand function, there will be functions that check if the hand's value will bust or count as a blackjackâ€”while also has functions that manipulate the cards in the chosen hand, so drawing, viewing, and discarding the hand after the round is over. The player and dealer class will depend on the hand class, as most of their functions will be used to manipulate the hand. This means hitting, standing, and splitting the hand. The player class will additionally have the option to see their name, how much money they currently have, how much they want to bet, and the additional options to double down or surrender during the round.

 > Card Class:
 > * setValue(int) sets cardValue
 > * setName(string) sets name
 > * setSuit(string) sets suit
 > * getValue() returns the cardValue
 > * getName() returns the name
 > * getSuit() returns the suit
 > Deck Class:
 > * generateDeck() generates a vector with 52 Card object
 > * shuffleDeck() mixes up order the of the vector
 > * drawCardDeck() returns a deleted Card object from the vector
 > Hand Class:
 > * checkBustHand() returns true if handValue is larger than 21
 > * checkJackHand() returns true if hadnValue is equals to 21 
 > * getValueHand() returns handValue
 > * drawCardHand() calls drawCardDeck() from deck class (adds a card from deck to hand)
 > * viewHand() (N/A)
 > * clearHand() clears the Hand<>
 > Dealer Class:
 > * dealerDraw() (N/A)
 > Player Class:
 > * getName() sets name
 > * viewMoney() returns money
 > * howManyHands() returns the number of hands
 > * hit() calls drawCardHand()
 > * stand() ends round, dealer's turn
 > * doubleDown() double the bet, hit once and stand
 > * splitHands() creates one more hand
 > * surrender() give up half of the bet and lose game

 > ## Phase III
 > You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
 
 > BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
 > * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
 > * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
 >   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
 >   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
 >     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
 >     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
 >     * How did this change help you write better code?
 > * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
 > * You should also make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
 
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss: 
 > * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
 > * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
 > * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
 > * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.

 
 > ## Final deliverable
 > All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members. 
 > Before the demo, you should do the following:
 > * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
 > * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
 > * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history. 
 
 ## Screenshots
 > Screenshots of the input/output after running your application
 ## Installation/Usage
 > Instructions on installing and running your application
 ## Testing
 > How was your project tested/validated? If you used CI, you should have a "build passing" badge in this README.
